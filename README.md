Hello, I am Mohammed Rizwan :raising_hand_man:
================================

I am Smart Contract Auditor and Security Researcher. I have been constantly exploring and learning about smart contract security from the past 7 months. In parallel, I am putting my all efforts to find bugs in Solidity smart contracts. 

I have been doing audits at Code4rena and Sherlock. The Audit reports can be seen by redirecting from following links.
